    <h1>A Famous Speech for the Ages</h1>
    Readers were treated to a cover story unlike anything the magazine had published before—David Foster
Wallace’s profile of John Ziegler, who was then a talk radio host in Los Angeles. In print,
Wallace’s signature multilayered footnotes appeared in colored annotations adjacent to the
primary text. Web design has advanced quite a bit in the decade since “Host” was published,
so we’ve taken the opportunity to recreate this story online with restyled annotations; to
read them, merely click or tap on the highlighted text. For example, we asked John Ziegler,
the subject of the profile, for some remarks on the story; you can read those by
    <span class="accordion">

        "I have done some rather large TV interviews in my career, but this cover story
        in <em>The Atlantic</em> is still how a lot of people know me best," John Ziegler
        wrote in an email. "I must point out that there are at least.

   Now, it is clear that the decline of a language must ultimately have political and
    economic causes: it is not due simply to the bad influence of this or that individual
    writer. But an effect can become a cause, reinforcing the original cause and producing
    the same effect in an intensified form,

        A man may take to drink because he feels himself to be a failure, and then
        fail all the more completely because he drinks. It is rather the same thing
        that is happening to the English language.

    It becomes ugly and inaccurate because our thoughts are foolish, but the slovenliness of
    our language makes it easier for us to have foolish thoughts.

        We were waiting outside the condemned cells, a row of sheds fronted with
    double bars, like small animal cages. Each cell measured about ten feet
    by ten and was quite bare within except for a plank bed and a pot of
    drinking water.

     In some of them brown silent men were squatting at the
    inner bars, with their blankets draped round them. These were the
    condemned men, due to be hanged within the next week or two.
