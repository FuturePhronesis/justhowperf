were treated to a cover story unlike anything the magazine had published before—David Foster
Wallace’s profile of John Ziegler, who was then a talk radio host in Los Angeles. In print,
Wallace’s signature multilayered footnotes appeared in colored annotations adjacent to the
primary text. Web design has advanced quite a bit in the decade since “Host” was published,
so we’ve taken the opportunity to recreate this story online with restyled annotations; to

    the same effect in an intensified form,
