<blockquote>
    Somewhere or other Byron makes use of the French word longeur, and remarks in passing that though in
    England we happen not to have the word, we have the thing in considerable profusion. In the same way,
    there is a habit of mind which is now so widespread that it affects our thinking on nearly every subject,
    but which has not yet been given a name. As the nearest existing equivalent I have chosen the word
    ‘nationalism’, but it will be seen in a moment that I am not using it in quite the ordinary sense,
    if only because the emotion I am speaking about does not always attach itself to what is called a
    nation — that is, a single race or a geographical area. It can attach itself to a church or a class,
    or it may work in a merely negative sense, against something or other and without the need for any
    positive object of loyalty.
<p></p>
    By ‘nationalism’ I mean first of all the habit of assuming that human beings can be classified like
    insects and that whole blocks of millions or tens of millions of people can be confidently labelled
    ‘good’ or ‘bad’(1). But secondly — and this is much more important — I mean the habit of identifying
    oneself with a single nation or other unit, placing it beyond good and evil and recognising no other
    duty than that of advancing its interests. Nationalism is not to be confused with patriotism. Both
    words are normally used in so vague a way that any definition is liable to be challenged, but one must
    draw a distinction between them, since two different and even opposing ideas are involved. By
    ‘patriotism’ I mean devotion to a particular place and a particular way of life, which one believes
    to be the best in the world but has no wish to force on other people. Patriotism is of its nature
    defensive, both militarily and culturally. Nationalism, on the other hand, is inseparable from the
    desire for power. The abiding purpose of every nationalist is to secure more power and more prestige,
    not for himself but for the nation or other unit in which he has chosen to sink his own individuality.
    <p></p>
    So long as it is applied merely to the more notorious and identifiable nationalist movements in Germany,
    Japan, and other countries, all this is obvious enough. Confronted with a phenomenon like Nazism, which
    we can observe from the outside, nearly all of us would say much the same things about it. But here I
    must repeat what I said above, that I am only using the word ‘nationalism’ for lack of a better.
    Nationalism, in the extended sense in which I am using the word, includes such movements and tendencies
    as Communism, political Catholicism, Zionism, Antisemitism, Trotskyism and Pacifism. It does not necessarily
    mean loyalty to a government or a country, still less to one's own country, and it is not even strictly
    necessary that the units in which it deals should actually exist. To name a few obvious examples, Jewry,
    Islam, Christendom, the Proletariat and the White Race are all of them objects of passionate nationalistic
    feeling: but their existence can be seriously questioned, and there is no definition of any one of them
    that would be universally accepted.
    <p></p>
    It is also worth emphasising once again that nationalist feeling can be purely negative. There are, for
    example, Trotskyists who have become simply enemies of the U.S.S.R. without developing a corresponding
    loyalty to any other unit. When one grasps the implications of this, the nature of what I mean by nationalism
    becomes a good deal clearer. A nationalist is one who thinks solely, or mainly, in terms of competitive
    prestige. He may be a positive or a negative nationalist — that is, he may use his mental energy either
    in boosting or in denigrating — but at any rate his thoughts always turn on victories, defeats, triumphs
    and humiliations. He sees history, especially contemporary history, as the endless rise and decline of
    great power units, and every event that happens seems to him a demonstration that his own side is on the
    upgrade and some hated rival is on the downgrade. But finally, it is important not to confuse nationalism
    with mere worship of success. The nationalist does not go on the principle of simply ganging up with
    the strongest side. On the contrary, having picked his side, he persuades himself that it is the
    strongest, and is able to stick to his belief even when the facts are overwhelmingly against him. Nationalism
    is power-hunger tempered by self-deception. Every nationalist is capable of the most flagrant dishonesty,
    but he is also — since he is conscious of serving something bigger than himself — unshakeably certain of
    being in the right.
    <p></p>
    Now that I have given this lengthy definition, I think it will be admitted that the habit of mind I am
    talking about is widespread among the English intelligentsia, and more widespread there than among the
    mass of the people. For those who feel deeply about contemporary politics, certain topics have become
    so infected by considerations of prestige that a genuinely rational approach to them is almost i
    mpossible. Out of the hundreds of examples that one might choose, take this question: Which of the
    three great allies, the U.S.S.R., Britain and the USA, has contributed most to the defeat of Germany?
    In theory, it should be possible to give a reasoned and perhaps even a conclusive answer to this question.
    In practice, however, the necessary calculations cannot be made, because anyone likely to bother his head
    about such a question would inevitably see it in terms of competitive prestige. He would therefore start
    by deciding in favour of Russia, Britain or America as the case might be, and only after this would
    begin searching for arguments that seemed to support his case. And there are whole strings of kindred
    questions to which you can only get an honest answer from someone who is indifferent to the whole subject
    involved, and whose opinion on it is probably worthless in any case. Hence, partly, the remarkable
    failure in our time of political and military prediction. It is curious to reflect that out of al the
    ‘experts’ of all the schools, there was not a single one who was able to foresee so likely an event
    as the Russo-German Pact of 1939(2). And when news of the Pact broke, the most wildly divergent
    explanations were of it were given, and predictions were made which were falsified almost immediately,
    being based in nearly every case not on a study of probabilities but on a desire to make the U.S.S.R.
    seem good or bad, strong or weak. Political or military commentators, like astrologers, can survive almost
    any mistake, because their more devoted followers do not look to them for an appraisal of the facts but
    for the stimulation of nationalistic loyalties(3). And aesthetic judgements, especially literary
    judgements, are often corrupted in the same way as political ones. It would be difficult for an Indian
    Nationalist to enjoy reading Kipling or for a Conservative to see merit in Mayakovsky, and there is
    always a temptation to claim that any book whose tendency one disagrees with must be a bad book from a
    literary point of view. People of strongly nationalistic outlook often perform this sleight of hand
    without being conscious of dishonesty.
    <p></p>
    In England, if one simply considers the number of people involved, it is probable that the dominant
    form of nationalism is old-fashioned British jingoism. It is certain that this is still widespread,
    and much more so than most observers would have believed a dozen years ago. However, in this essay I
    am concerned chiefly with the reactions of the intelligentsia, among whom jingoism and even patriotism
    of the old kind are almost dead, though they now seem to be reviving among a minority. Among the
    intelligentsia, it hardly needs saying that the dominant form of nationalism is Communism — using this
    word in a very loose sense, to include not merely Communist Party members, but ‘fellow travellers’ and
    russophiles generally. A Communist, for my purpose here, is one who looks upon the U.S.S.R. as his
    Fatherland and feels it his duty t justify Russian policy and advance Russian interests at all costs.
    Obviously such people abound in England today, and their direct and indirect influence is very great.
    But many other forms of nationalism also flourish, and it is by noticing the points of resemblance
    between different and even seemingly opposed currents of thought that one can best get the matter into perspective.
    <p></p>
    Ten or twenty years ago, the form of nationalism most closely corresponding to Communism today was
    political Catholicism. Its most outstanding exponent — though he was perhaps an extreme case rather
    than a typical one — was G. K. Chesterton. Chesterton was a writer of considerable talent who whose
    to suppress both his sensibilities and his intellectual honesty in the cause of Roman Catholic propaganda.
    During the last twenty years or so of his life, his entire output was in reality an endless repetition
    of the same thing, under its laboured cleverness as simple and boring as ‘Great is Diana of the Ephesians.’
    Every book that he wrote, every scrap of dialogue, had to demonstrate beyond the possibility of mistake
    the superiority of the Catholic over the Protestant or the pagan. But Chesterton was not content to think
    of this superiority as merely intellectual or spiritual: it had to be translated into terms of national
    prestige and military power, which entailed an ignorant idealisation of the Latin countries, especially
    France. Chesterton had not lived long in France, and his picture of it — as a land of Catholic peasants
    incessantly singing the Marseillaise over glasses of red wine — had about as much relation to reality as
    Chu Chin Chow has to everyday life in Baghdad. And with this went not only an enormous overestimation of
    French military power (both before and after 1914-18 he maintained that France, by itself, was stronger
    than Germany), but a silly and vulgar glorification of the actual process of war. Chesterton's battle
    poems, such as Lepanto or The Ballad of Saint Barbara, make The Charge of the Light Brigade read like
    a pacifist tract: they are perhaps the most tawdry bits of bombast to be found in our language. The
    interesting thing is that had the romantic rubbish which he habitually wrote about France and the
    French army been written by somebody else about Britain and the British army, he would have been the
    first to jeer. In home politics he was a Little Englander, a true hater of jingoism and imperialism,
    and according to his lights a true friend of democracy. Yet when he looked outwards into the international
    field, he could forsake his principles without even noticing he was doing so. Thus, his almost mystical
    belief in the virtues of democracy did not prevent him from admiring Mussolini. Mussolini had destroyed
    the representative government and the freedom of the press for which Chesterton had struggled so hard at
    home, but Mussolini was an Italian and had made Italy strong, and that settled the matter. Nor did
    Chesterton ever find a word to say about imperialism and the conquest of coloured races when they were
    practised by Italians or Frenchmen. His hold on reality, his literary taste, and even to some extent
    his moral sense, were dislocated as soon as his nationalistic loyalties were involved.
    <p></p>
    Obviously there are considerable resemblances between political Catholicism, as exemplified by Chesterton,
    and Communism. So there are between either of these and for instance Scottish nationalism, Zionism,
    Antisemitism or Trotskyism. It would be an oversimplification to say that all forms of nationalism
    are the same, even in their mental atmosphere, but there are certain rules that hold good in all
    cases. The following are the principal characteristics of nationalist thought:
    <p></p>
    Obsession. As nearly as possible, no nationalist ever thinks, talks, or writes about anything except
    the superiority of his own power unit. It is difficult if not impossible for any nationalist to conceal
    his allegiance. The smallest slur upon his own unit, or any implied praise of a rival organization,
    fills him with uneasiness which he can relieve only by making some sharp retort. If the chosen unit
    is an actual country, such as Ireland or India, he will generally claim superiority for it not only
    in military power and political virtue, but in art, literature, sport, structure of the language,
    the physical beauty of the inhabitants, and perhaps even in climate, scenery and cooking. He will show
    great sensitiveness about such things as the correct display of flags, relative size of headlines and
    the order in which different countries are named(4). Nomenclature plays a very important part in
    nationalist thought. Countries which have won their independence or gone through a nationalist revolution
    usually change their names, and any country or other unit round which strong feelings revolve is likely
    to have several names, each of them carrying a different implication. The two sides of the Spanish Civil
    War had between them nine or ten names expressing different degrees of love and hatred. Some of these
    names (e. g. ‘Patriots’ for Franco-supporters, or ‘Loyalists’ for Government-supporters) were frankly
    question-begging, and there was no single one of the which the two rival factions could have agreed to
    use. All nationalists consider it a duty to spread their own language to the detriment of rival languages,
    and among English-speakers this struggle reappears in subtler forms as a struggle between dialects.
    Anglophobe-Americans will refuse to use a slang phrase if they know it to be of British origin, and the
    conflict between Latinizers and Germanizers often has nationalists motives behind it. Scottish nationalists
    insist on the superiority of Lowland Scots, and socialists whose nationalism takes the form of class
    hatred tirade against the B.B.C. accent and even the often gives the impression of being tinged by belief
    in symphatetic magic — a belief which probably comes out in the widespread custom of burning political
    enemies in effigy, or using pictures of them as targets in shooting galleries.
<p></p>
    Instability. The intensity with which they are held does not prevent nationalist loyalties from being
    transferable. To begin with, as I have pointed out already, they can be and often are fastened up on
    some foreign country. One quite commonly finds that great national leaders, or the founders of nationalist
    movements, do not even belong to the country they have glorified. Sometimes they are outright foreigners,
    or more often they come from peripheral areas where nationality is doubtful. Examples are Stalin, Hitler,
    Napoleon, de Valera, Disraeli, Poincare, Beaverbrook. The Pan-German movement was in part the creation of
    an Englishman, Houston Chamberlain. For the past fifty or a hundred years, transferred nationalism has
    been a common phenomenon among literary intellectuals. With Lafcadio Hearne the transference was to
    Japan, with Carlyle and many others of his time to Germany, and in our own age it is usually to Russia.
    But the peculiarly interesting fact is that re-transference is also possible. A country or other unit
    which has been worshipped for years may suddenly become detestable, and some other object of affection
    may take its place with almost no interval. In the first version of H. G. Wells's Outline of History,
    and others of his writings about that time, one finds the United States praised almost as extravagantly
    as Russia is praised by Communists today: yet within a few years this uncritical admiration had turned
    into hostility. The bigoted Communist who changes in a space of weeks, or even days, into an equally
    bigoted Trotskyist is a common spectacle. In continental Europe Fascist movements were largely recruited
    from among Communists, and the opposite process may well happen within the next few years. What remains
    constant in the nationalist is his state of mind: the object of his feelings is changeable, and may be imaginary.
    <p></p>
    But for an intellectual, transference has an important function which I have already mentioned shortly
    in connection with Chesterton. It makes it possible for him to be much more nationalistic — more vulgar,
    more silly, more malignant, more dishonest — that he could ever be on behalf of his native country,
    or any unit of which he had real knowledge. When one sees the slavish or boastful rubbish that is
    written about Stalin, the Red Army, etc. by fairly intelligent and sensitive people, one realises
    that this is only possible because some kind of dislocation has taken place. In societies such as ours,
    it is unusual for anyone describable as an intellectual to feel a very deep attachment to his own country.
    Public opinion — that is, the section of public opinion of which he as an intellectual is aware — will
    not allow him to do so. Most of the people surrounding him are sceptical and disaffected, and he may
    adopt the same attitude from imitativeness or sheer cowardice: in that case he will have abandoned the
    form of nationalism that lies nearest to hand without getting any closer to a genuinely internationalist
    outlook. He still feels the need for a Fatherland, and it is natural to look for one somewhere abroad.
    Having found it, he can wallow unrestrainedly in exactly those emotions from which he believes that he
    has emancipated himself. God, the King, the Empire, the Union Jack — all the overthrown idols can
    reappear under different names, and because they are not recognised for what they are they can be
    worshipped with a good conscience. Transferred nationalism, like the use of scapegoats, is a way of
    attaining salvation without altering one's conduct.
    <p></p>
    Indifference to Reality. All nationalists have the power of not seeing resemblances between similar
    sets of facts. A British Tory will defend self-determination in Europe and oppose it in India with no
    feeling of inconsistency. Actions are held to be good or bad, not on their own merits, but according
    to who does them, and there is almost no kind of outrage — torture, the use of hostages, forced labour,
    mass deportations, imprisonment without trial, forgery, assassination, the bombing of civilians — which
    does not change its moral colour when it is committed by ‘our’ side. The Liberal News Chronicle published,
    as an example of shocking barbarity, photographs of Russians hanged by the Germans, and then a year or
    two later published with warm approval almost exactly similar photographs of Germans hanged by the
    Russians(5). It is the same with historical events. History is thought of largely in nationalist terms,
    and such things as the Inquisition, the tortures of the Star Chamber, the exploits of the English
    buccaneers (Sir Francis Drake, for instance, who was given to sinking Spanish prisoners alive), the
    Reign of Terror, the heroes of the Mutiny blowing hundreds of Indians from the guns, or Cromwell's
    soldiers slashing Irishwomen's faces with razors, become morally neutral or even meritorious when it
    is felt that they were done in the ‘right’ cause. If one looks back over the past quarter of a century,
    one finds that there was hardly a single year when atrocity stories were not being reported from some
    part of the world; and yet in not one single case were these atrocities — in Spain, Russia, China,
    Hungary, Mexico, Amritsar, Smyrna — believed in and disapproved of by the English intelligentsia as a
    whole. Whether such deeds were reprehensible, or even whether they happened, was always decided
    according to political predilection.
    <p></p>
    The nationalist not only does not disapprove of atrocities committed by his own side, but he has a
    remarkable capacity for not even hearing about them. For quite six years the English admirers of
    Hitler contrived not to learn of the existence of Dachau and Buchenwald. And those who are loudest in
    denouncing the German concentration camps are often quite unaware, or only very dimly aware, that
    there are also concentration camps in Russia. Huge events like the Ukraine famine of 1933, involving
    the deaths of millions of people, have actually escaped the attention of the majority of English
    russophiles. Many English people have heard almost nothing about the extermination of German and Polish
    Jews during the present war. Their own antisemitism has caused this vast crime to bounce off their
    consciousness. In nationalist thought there are facts which are both true and untrue, known and unknown.
    A known fact may be so unbearable that it is habitually pushed aside and not allowed to enter into
    logical processes, or on the other hand it may enter into every calculation and yet never be admitted
    as a fact, even in one's own mind.
    <p></p>
    Every nationalist is haunted by the belief that the past can be altered. He spends part of his time
    in a fantasy world in which things happen as they should — in which, for example, the Spanish Armada
    was a success or the Russian Revolution was crushed in 1918 — and he will transfer fragments of this
    world to the history books whenever possible. Much of the propagandist writing of our time amounts to
    plain forgery. Material facts are suppressed, dates altered, quotations removed from their context and
    doctored so as to change their meaning. Events which it is felt ought not to have happened are left
    unmentioned and ultimately denied(6). In 1927 Chiang Kai Shek boiled hundreds of Communists alive, and
    yet within ten years he had become one of the heroes of the Left. The re-alignment of world politics
    had brought him into the anti-Fascist camp, and so it was felt that the boiling of the Communists
    ‘didn't count’, or perhaps had not happened. The primary aim of propaganda is, of course, to influence
    contemporary opinion, but those who rewrite history do probably believe with part of their minds that
    they are actually thrusting facts into the past. When one considers the elaborate forgeries that have
    been committed in order to show that Trotsky did not play a valuable part in the Russian civil war,
    it is difficult to feel that the people responsible are merely lying. More probably they feel that
    their own version was what happened in the sight of God, and that one is justified in rearranging the
    records accordingly.
    <p></p>
    Indifference to objective truth is encouraged by the sealing-off of one part of the world from another,
    which makes it harder and harder to discover what is actually happening. There can often be a genuine
    doubt about the most enormous events. For example, it is impossible to calculate within millions,
    perhaps even tens of millions, the number of deaths caused by the present war. The calamities that
    are constantly being reported — battles, massacres, famines, revolutions — tend to inspire in the
    average person a feeling of unreality. One has no way of verifying the facts, one is not even fully
    certain that they have happened, and one is always presented with totally different interpretations
    from different sources. What were the rights and wrongs of the Warsaw rising of August 1944? Is it
    true about the German gas ovens in Poland? Who was really to blame for the Bengal famine? Probably
    the truth is discoverable, but the facts will be so dishonestly set forth in almost any newspaper
    that the ordinary reader can be forgiven either for swallowing lies or failing to form an opinion.
    The general uncertainty as to what is really happening makes it easier to cling to lunatic beliefs.
    Since nothing is ever quite proved or disproved, the most unmistakable fact can be impudently denied.
    Moreover, although endlessly brooding on power, victory, defeat, revenge, the nationalist is often
    somewhat uninterested in what happens in the real world. What he wants is to feel that his own unit is
    getting the better of some other unit, and he can more easily do this by scoring off an adversary than
    by examining the facts to see whether they support him. All nationalist controversy is at the
    debating-society level. It is always entirely inconclusive, since each contestant invariably believes
    himself to have won the victory. Some nationalists are not far from schizophrenia, living quite happily
    amid dreams of power and conquest which have no connection with the physical world.
<p></p>
    I have examined as best as I can the mental habits which are common to all forms of nationalism.
    The next thing is to classify those forms, but obviously this cannot be done comprehensively.
    Nationalism is an enormous subject. The world is tormented by innumerable delusions and hatreds which
    cut across one another in an extremely complex way, and some of the most sinister of them have not yet
    impinged on the European consciousness. In this essay I am concerned with nationalism as it occurs among
    the English intelligentsia. In them, much more than in ordinary English people, it is unmixed with
    patriotism and therefore can be studied pure. Below are listed the varieties of nationalism now flourishing
    among English intellectuals, with such comments as seem to be needed. It is convenient to use three
    headings, Positive, Transferred, and Negative, though some varieties will fit into more than one category:
