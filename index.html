    <h1>Famous Essay for the Awesome People</h1>
    Saints should always be judged guilty until they are proved innocent, but the tests that have to
    be applied to them are not, of course, the same in all cases. In Gandhi’s case the questions one
    feels inclined to ask are: to what extent was Gandhi moved by vanity — by the consciousness of
    himself as a humble, naked old man, sitting on a praying-mat and shaking empires by sheer spiritual
    power — and to what extent did he compromise his own principles by entering politics, which of
    their nature are inseparable from coercion and fraud? To give a definite answer one would have to
    study Gandhi’s acts and writings in immense detail, for his whole life was a sort of pilgrimage in
    which every act was significant. But this partial autobiography, which ends in the nineteen-twenties,
    is strong evidence in his favour, all the more because it covers what he would have called the
    unregenerate part of his life and reminds one that inside the saint, or near-saint, there was a
    very shrewd, able person who could, if he had chosen, have been a brilliant success as a lawyer,
    an administrator or perhaps even a businessman.
<p></p>
    At about the time when the autobiography [1] first appeared I remember reading its opening chapters
    in the ill-printed pages of some Indian newspaper. They made a good impression on me, which Gandhi
    himself at that time, did not. The things that one associated with him — home-spun cloth, ‘soul forces’
    and vegetarianism — were unappealing, and his medievalist programme was obviously not viable in a
    backward, starving, overpopulated country. It was also apparent that the British were making use of
    him, or thought they were making use of him. Strictly speaking, as a Nationalist, he was an enemy,
    but since in every crisis he would exert himself to prevent violence — which, from the British point
    of view, meant preventing any effective action whatever — he could be regarded as ‘our man’. In private
    this was sometimes cynically admitted. The attitude of the Indian millionaires was similar. Gandhi
    called upon them to repent, and naturally they preferred him to the Socialists and Communists who,
    given the chance, would actually have taken their money away. How reliable such calculations are in
    the long run is doubtful; as Gandhi himself says, ‘in the end deceivers deceive only themselves’; but
    at any rate the gentleness with which he was nearly always handled was due partly to the feeling that
    he was useful. The British Conservatives only became really angry with him when, as in 1942, he was in
    effect turning his non-violence against a different conqueror.
<p></p>
    But I could see even then that the British officials who spoke of him with a mixture of amusement and
    disapproval also genuinely liked and admired him, after a fashion. Nobody ever suggested that he was
    corrupt, or ambitious in any vulgar way, or that anything he did was actuated by fear or malice. In
    judging a man like Gandhi one seems instinctively to apply high standards, so that some of his virtues
    have passed almost unnoticed. For instance, it is clear even from the autobiography that his natural
    physical courage was quite outstanding: the manner of his death was a later illustration of this, for a
    public man who attached any value to his own skin would have been more adequately guarded. Again, he
    seems to have been quite free from that maniacal suspiciousness which, as E. M. Forster rightly says
    in A Passage to India, is the besetting Indian vice, as hypocrisy is the British vice. Although no
    doubt he was shrewd enough in detecting dishonesty, he seems wherever possible to have believed that
    other people were acting in good faith and had a better nature through which they could be approached.
    And though he came of a poor middle-class family, started life rather unfavourably, and was probably of
    unimpressive physical appearance, he was not afflicted by envy or by the feeling of inferiority. Colour
    feeling when he first met it in its worst form in South Africa, seems rather to have astonished him.
    Even when he was fighting what was in effect a colour war he did not think of people in terms of race
    or status. The governor of a province, a cotton millionaire, a half-starved Dravidian coolie, a British
    private soldier,  were all equally human beings, to be approached in much the same way. It is noticeable
    that even in the worst possible circumstances, as in South Africa when he was making himself unpopular
    as the champion of the Indian community, he did not lack European friends.
<p></p>
    Written in short lengths for newspaper serialization, the autobiography is not a literary masterpiece,
    but it is the more impressive because of the commonplaceness of much of its material. It is well to be
    reminded that Gandhi started out with the normal ambitions of a young Indian student and only adopted
    his extremist opinions by degrees and, in some cases, rather unwillingly. There was a time, it is
    interesting to learn, when he wore a top hat, took dancing lessons, studied French and Latin, went up
    the Eiffel Tower and even tried to learn the violin — all this was the idea of assimilating European
    civilization as thoroughly as possible. He was not one of those saints who are marked out by their
    phenomenal piety from childhood onwards, nor one of the other kind who forsake the world after sensational
    debaucheries. He makes full confession of the misdeeds of his youth, but in fact there is not much to
    confess. As a frontispiece to the book there is a photograph of Gandhi’s possessions at the time of his
    death. The whole outfit could be purchased for about £5, and Gandhi’s sins, at least his fleshly sins,
    would make the same sort of appearance if placed all in one heap. A few cigarettes, a few mouthfuls of
    meat, a few annas pilfered in childhood from the maidservant, two visits to a brothel (on each occasion
    he got away without ‘doing anything’), one narrowly escaped lapse with his landlady in Plymouth, one
    outburst of temper — that is about the whole collection. Almost from childhood onwards he had a deep
    earnestness, an attitude ethical rather than religious, but, until he was about thirty, no very definite
    sense of direction. His first entry into anything describable as public life was made by way of vegetarianism.
    Underneath his less ordinary qualities one feels all the time the solid middle-class businessmen who were
    his ancestors. One feels that even after he had abandoned personal ambition he must have been a resourceful,
    energetic lawyer and a hard-headed political organizer, careful in keeping down expenses, an adroit handler
    of committees and an indefatigable chaser of subscriptions. His character was an extraordinarily mixed one,
    but there was almost nothing in it that you can put your finger on and call bad, and I believe that even
    Gandhi’s worst enemies would admit that he was an interesting and unusual man who enriched the world simply
    by being alive. Whether he was also a lovable man, and whether his teachings can have much for those who do
    not accept the religious beliefs on which they are founded, I have never felt fully certain.

    Of late years it has been the fashion to talk about Gandhi as though he were not only sympathetic to the
    western left-wing movement, but were integrally part of it. Anarchists and pacifists, in particular, have
    claimed him for their own, noticing only that he was opposed to centralism and State violence and ignoring
    the other-worldly, anti-humanist tendency of his doctrines. But one should, I think, realize that Gandhi’s
    teachings cannot be squared with the belief that Man is the measure of all things, and that our job is to
    make life worth living on this earth, which is the only earth we have. They make sense only on the assumption
    that God exists and that the world of solid objects is an illusion to be escaped from. It is worth considering
    the disciplines which Gandhi imposed on himself and which — though he might not insist on every one of his
    followers observing every detail — he considered indispensable if one wanted to serve either God or humanity.
    First of all, no meat eating, and if possible no animal food in any form. (Gandhi himself, for the sake of
    his health, had to compromise on milk, but seems to have felt this to be a backsliding.) No alcohol or tobacco,
    and no spices or condiments, even of a vegetable kind, since food should be taken not for its own sake but
    solely in order to preserve one’s strength. Secondly, if possible, no sexual intercourse. If sexual intercourse
    must happen, then it should be for the sole purpose of begetting children and presumably at long intervals.
    Gandhi himself, in his middle thirties, took the vow of brahmacharya, which means not only complete chastity
    but the elimination of sexual desire. This condition, it seems, is difficult to attain without a special diet
    and frequent fasting. One of the dangers of milk-drinking is that it is apt to arouse sexual desire. And
    finally — this is the cardinal point — for the seeker after goodness there must be no close friendships and
    no exclusive loves whatever.
<p></p>
    Close friendships, Gandhi says, are dangerous, because ‘friends react on one another’ and through loyalty
    to a friend one can be led into wrong-doing. This is unquestionably true. Moreover, if one is to love God,
    or to love humanity as a whole, one cannot give one’s preference to any individual person. This again is
    true, and it marks the point at which the humanistic and the religious attitude cease to be reconcilable.
    To an ordinary human being, love means nothing if it does not mean loving some people more than others.
    The autobiography leaves it uncertain whether Gandhi behaved in an inconsiderate way to his wife and children,
    but at any rate it makes clear that on three occasions he was willing to let his wife or a child die rather
    than administer the animal food prescribed by the doctor. It is true that the threatened death never actually
    occurred, and also that Gandhi — with, one gathers, a good deal of moral pressure in the opposite direction —
    always gave the patient the choice of staying alive at the price of committing a sin: still, if the decision
    had been solely his own, he would have forbidden the animal food, whatever the risks might be. There must, he
    says, be some limit to what we will do in order to remain alive, and the limit is well on this side of chicken
    broth. This attitude is perhaps a noble one, but, in the sense which — I think — most people would give to the
    word, it is inhuman. The essence of being human is that one does not seek perfection, that one is sometimes
    willing to commit sins for the sake of loyalty, that one does not push asceticism to the point where it makes
    friendly intercourse impossible, and that one is prepared in the end to be defeated and broken up by life,
    which is the inevitable price of fastening one’s love upon other human individuals. No doubt alcohol, tobacco
    and so forth are things that a saint must avoid, but sainthood is also a thing that human beings must avoid.
    There is an obvious retort to this, but one should be wary about making it. In this yogi-ridden age, it is
    too readily assumed that ‘non-attachment’ is not only better than a full acceptance of earthly life, but
    that the ordinary man only rejects it because it is too difficult: in other words, that the average human
    being is a failed saint. It is doubtful whether this is true. Many people genuinely do not wish to be saints,
    and it is probable that some who achieve or aspire to sainthood have never felt much temptation to be human
    beings. If one could follow it to its psychological roots, one would, I believe, find that the main motive for
    ‘non-attachment’ is a desire to escape from the pain of living, and above all from love, which, sexual or
    non-sexual, is hard work. But it is not necessary here to argue whether the other-worldly or the humanistic
    ideal is ‘higher’. The point is that they are incompatible. One must choose between God and Man, and all
    ‘radicals’ and ‘progressives’, from the mildest Liberal to the most extreme Anarchist, have in effect chosen Man.
