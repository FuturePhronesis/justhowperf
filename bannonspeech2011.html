        far surpassed those of previous bankrupt giants such as WorldCom and Enron. Lehman was the

    heart of the world's commercial paper market, in that the entire world, in the commercial
    paper market is what funds the working capital of all the large corporations in the world.
    That the world's financial system had basically frozen. And on Wednesday, for all you guys
    that have money market accounts, the prime reserve fund broke a buck for the first time. In
    other words, if you wrote a check four thousand dollars, you're going to get nine hundred
    dollars back. The Fed had pumped 500 billion dollars of liquidity in 24 hours into the
    system. And by the way, we know all this now because of

    They did the spreadsheets and ran the numbers, and they went and told the president that they needed

        <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wnet/need-to-know/economy/the-true-cost-of-the-bank-bailout/3309/" target="_blank">
            Bloomberg</a> piece from September 2010 that aligns fairly close to the information Bannon gives.
    </div>
            </span>
        </span>it was about five trillion dollars of liquidity they needed into the system,
    of which, by the way, we've never really had an accounting. Right? We don't have an accounting today
    of what really went on and what liquidity got put into the system. This crisis is of such a magnitude.
    It's unprecedented in our country's history and unprecedented the world's history.
    <p></p>
    Let me just walk you through some math. Depending on the assumptions you make – Medicare, Social
    Security, Medicaid, and I realize people say ‘oh they're contingent liabilities,’ but they're pretty
    locked in unless you uncontingent them. The liabilities of those three are anywhere from sixty to a
    hundred trillion dollars. At a state level, the state governments today are about three trillion dollars
    underwater. Municipal governments - you see in Harrisburg, the capital of Pennsylvania, things just got
    taken over yesterday - municipal governments, I think are something like two trillion dollars underwater.
    Municipal employee pension funds are two trillion and corporate pension funds are a trillion dollars. The
    biggest problem we have which never gets talked about at any debate, has not been brought up one time -
    the trade deficit - which every quarter all the goods we buy from China, and all the foreign oil we buy,
    it’s seven trillion dollars. It's the beating heart of our problem - not one question in eight debates has
    been asked about it.

    <div id="accordion-9" class="accordion-section-content-green">
        Dr. Laurence Kotlikoff. As far as can be researched, Dr. Kotlikoff was never the head of Boston Universitys'
        Economics Department, though he is currently a professor there. Since 2009 he has been recognized as a William
        Fairfield Distinguished Professor, a title given to the most senior and distinguished professors in the department.
        It is perhaps that title that Bannon was thinking of when he speaks of him as the "head" of the department.
        He was one of Reagan's Council of Economic Advisers. He has also run for president as a write-in candidate
        in both the 2012 and 2016 elections. He didn't win either time.

    PhD, head of Boston University's Economics Department - very low-key guy. They call him the 200
    trillion-dollar man. He will walk you through a set of mathematics that shows you the liability side of
    the balance sheets about 200 trillion dollars, and his math is not that far from like the assumptions.
    The total assets in our country - let’s talk about a balance sheet and income statement so you can see
    the scale of the problem we got - all the assets combined, I think, in our country - all the stocks,
    Nasdaq, New York Stock Exchange, privately held companies, LLCs, all your companies, okay. All the cash,
    all the gold, all the real estate -  adds up to about 50 to 60 trillion dollars in assets. And we have
    200 trillion dollars and some of those contingent liabilities. But we are upside down.

    The industrial democracies have a massive problem today we've never had. We are highly overleveraged.
    We have to go through a massive deleveraging. And we've built in a welfare state that is completely
    and totally unsupportable. Now, why … this is a crisis, and by the way, Barack Obama is not the problem.
    Barack Obama is a symptom of a problem. We have to remove Barack Obama. I don't doubt that for a second.
    We have to remove Barack Obama as president of the United States. But that's only the … and let's talk
    about this. We had this huge … the reason you're here today on a Tuesday night, listening to some really
    great guys who are sacrificing their lives and you guys to come to support in one of these new
    organizations when you could be doing anything else. And you're the kind of the thin blue line of what's
    going to save us. Because I go around and talk to two groups last night was in Torrance, it's a hundred
    people, it's always the same hundred guys. Men and women, throughout the country, every time I go, ok?
    <P></P>
    That's the scary thing. You are the guys are really going to save us. So the problem is that these
    numbers are so esoteric that even the guys  of Wall Street - the Goldman Sachs, the guys I work with,
    and the guys in the Treasury Department, because they've made some massive mistakes - and they're the
    first to admit that - but it's so tough to tie this together because the numbers are so esoteric,
    when you talk about a trillion and a half dollar deficits and three trillion dollars on federal spending

       This is an odd one. In February 2009, a CNBC commentator named Rick Santelli gave an epic rant on the floor of

        Origin stories aside, the Tea Party movement came to prominence in the spring of 2009. The movement was a

        election of Barack Obama. They are staunchly against any government overreach and are financially and socially

    The Occupy Wall Street protest began in September, 2011. The protest was centralized around Zuccotti Park, in the
        financial district of New York City. Largely made up of younger people, the main issues were both social and
        economic inequality and the greed and corruption many saw at the root of large corporations. There was never
        a strongly stated platform, an ambiguity that was largely by design. In the months that the protest was active,
        the movement spread, with solidarity protests occurring in cities across the globe. The protest ended, in
        New York at least, when the police forced the protesters out of the park in November of 2011.

    nothing about our history. That’s why I call them generation zero. We've passed on zero net worth and we've

    &nbsp;the great fourth turning
</a>
            <div id="accordion-19" class="accordion-section-content-red">
        The idea of a "turning" in history, specifically in American history, is one that has taken root in Bannon.
                The basic idea of "turnings" in history comes from <em>The Fourth Turning</em>, a book written by
                historians William Strauss and Neil Howe. It describes the cyclical nature of history broken down into
                four "turnings" or mood eras. These four are known as "The High," "The Awakening," "The Unraveling,"
                and "The Crisis."
                Bannon equates the American Revolution, The Civil War, and the Depression leaded to World War II
                to "The Crisis" turnings that America has experienced. The common thought for those that ascribe to
                this tenant is that the United States is due for another "Crisis" turning.

        had an education in a value system of Judeo-Christian values that a guy like Abraham Lincoln could read

        right? Not only at the federal level, if you go down and look at the state level, if you look at we
        eviscerated the Democratic Party in the south and the midwest and state legislatures in the governorships,
        it was a massive victory. We got virtually no credit for that, right? The mainstream media, and even the
        Republican apparatus … remember the Republican Party came out with a marketing document 60 days before

        This is a somewhat unnecessary step. Since the passing of the Hyde Amendment in 1973, there has been a ban on
        federal funds being used for abortions except in case of incest, rape, or if the woman's life is in danger. In
        1993, Bill Clinton signed into law an updated form of Hyde that expanded the exception list to be available
        under Medicaid. If repealed, centers such as Planned Parenthood would lose the vast majority of their funding,
        regardless of the fact that they are legally unable to use those funds for abortions.

            Okay, the two big things - TARP being one. The second being the budget cuts after the 2010, right?
            The first budget - we cut 30 billion dollars. And, by the way, the Tea Party Patriots, if you go
            to Jenny Beth Martin and Mark Meckler’s site, they say we actually increased by 3 billion dollars,
            but it was a 30 billion dollar cut. Not a hundred billion dollar cut, because of all kind of, you
            know, we’re prorated … we’re in the year.
 <p></p>
            The second was the debt debate. The federal spending, which is every bit as bad as the deficit,
            it's the scale of federal spending, because it sucks dollars out from everywhere else. Federal
            spending, I think, is 3.5 trillion - 3.75 trillion for the next two years, roughly. It adds up to
            seven and a half trillion dollars in two years. In the debt debate we just had we cut 60 billion
            dollars. 20 billion one year and 40 billion the next. The numbers … those numbers are irrelevant,
            right? Because the system lacks the political courage to actually take it on.

       June 24, 2016 the Western world woke to find that the United Kingdom had voted to leave the European Union. It
                was, to say the least, shocking. But, Brexit, as it's so cutely been termed, has its roots in years
                upon years of debate. The European Economic Community (EEC) was founded in 1957 and is the direct
                predecessor to the European Union (founded in 1993). As soon as 1975 the UK was voting on whether to
                stay or leave the EEC. These debates continued throughout the next 40 some odd years, and coincided
                with the rise of the UK Independence Party (UKIP). By 2009 UKIP had established its place as a legitimate
                party in the UK. In the debate Bannon mentions, the idea of introducing a referendum was still largely
                unsupported in the government, but the pressure to have one was rapidly increasing.

                We have that opportunity today, right? They're going to look back at these 10 years, 15 years,
                and it's gonna take us that long, and we're gonna have .. by the way, we're going to have
                defeats. There's gonna be days when it looks … that's why I want you guys to see the movie
                <em>Generation Zero,</em> because the guy at the end of it tells you, kind of gives a broad
                perspective. They're going to be days it’s gonna look so grey and so overcast and like we've
                lost like, the day Obama won. We're going to have more days like that. But if we hold together
                and we see … exactly what you said … there's so many people that believe in what we believe,
                and understand when you start talking to them and engaging them, that, you know, we're not
                cloven-hoofed Devils. We’re not nativist, homophobic, racist, right? But they understand
                that we believe in what made this country great, and they believe it too.

            But they're inundated with a mass media in an education system that's really stolen that from

        Matt Drudge started the <em>Drudge Report,</em> a conservative blog and news aggregator, in the mid to late 1990s. The
        site really took off with it's publishing of stories surrounding the Monica Lewinsky scandal. During this same
        time, Drudge met, and eventually mentored, Andrew Breitbart. Breitbart would strike out on his own in 2005 and
        found the conservative news outlet, <em>Breitbart.</em> Only a few months from the time of Bannon's speech,
        in March, 2012, Breitbart would die of a heart attack.

            This one has been tough to track down. There are a lot of ideas out there surrounding the social
                contract, and even a handful that relate directly to the idea that the preceding generation should
                provide better opportunities to the next generation. That being said, it's been difficult to find
                any single concept that relates to the Birkin [sp?] Compact. Any help here would be greatly appreciated.

                And we have a sacred duty to withhold traditions of the past, our best traditions, and pass
                them on to the future. Only one generation in our history didn't do that. That was the generation
                of leadership before the Civil War. The Civil War could have been averted it wasn’t. Because
                of a failure of leadership. We are the baby boomers, in this room, we’re the second generation
                that's going to be looked at as having let this country down, unless we turn immediately and
                get our hands on the problem.  Through the Tea Party, through these grassroots movements,
                through things like Liberty Restoration, we're doing that. And trust me, there's tremendous
                power in doing this. So, thank you very much. I'm here to help you guys anytime you want.
