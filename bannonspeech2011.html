were treated to a cover story unlike anything the magazine had published before—David Foster
Wallace’s profile of John Ziegler, who was then a talk radio host in Los Angeles. In print,
Wallace’s signature multilayered footnotes appeared in colored annotations adjacent to the
primary text. Web design has advanced quite a bit in the decade since “Host” was published,
so we’ve taken the opportunity to recreate this story online with restyled annotations; to
read them, merely click or tap on the highlighted text. For example, we asked John Ziegler,
the subject of the profile, for some remarks on the story; you can read those by
<a class="annotation-link" data-annotation="-1" href="#"
   data-omni-click="r'article',r'link',r'0',r'303812'">
    clicking on these words.
