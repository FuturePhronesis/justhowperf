    I’m a naval officer. A real naval officer, not a graduate of the Naval Academy. No,
    we had good news - all your naval academy grads out there don't … We
    got very good news today. My daughter is a graduate of West Point and she's a member
    of the 326 Combat Engineers at the Hundred First Airborne and they got their orders.
    Yeah. That's the generation that we've got coming up these are great kids. She actually
    got her orders home today so she'll be back and forth Campbell by Thanksgiving so it's a
    it's a day of celebration our family. Yeah she … they're great kids. I’ll get to that in a
    second about what we've done to them, that generation.

        Ben Bernake was Fed Chairman from 2006-2014. Hank Paulson was the Secretary of the Treasury from 2006-2009.
        Paulson worked at Goldman Sachs from 1974 until he took over as Secretary of the Treasury in 2009. When he left
        Goldman he liquidated his stock holdings, but wasn't subject to capital gains tax, saving him an estimated $50

        "On September 15, 2008, Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy. With $639 billion in assets and
        $619 billion in debt, Lehman's bankruptcy filing was the largest in history, as its assets
        far surpassed those of previous bankrupt giants such as WorldCom and Enron. Lehman was the
        fourth-largest U.S. investment bank at the time of its collapse, with 25,000 employees worldwide."

    because it's quite complicated, they didn't realize that Lehman Brothers was the beating
    heart of the world's commercial paper market, in that the entire world, in the commercial
    paper market is what funds the working capital of all the large corporations in the world.
    That the world's financial system had basically frozen. And on Wednesday, for all you guys
    that have money market accounts, the prime reserve fund broke a buck for the first time. In
    other words, if you wrote a check four thousand dollars, you're going to get nine hundred
    dollars back. The Fed had pumped 500 billion dollars of liquidity in 24 hours into the
    system. And by the way, we know all this now because of
