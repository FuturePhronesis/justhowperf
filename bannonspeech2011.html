        far surpassed those of previous bankrupt giants such as WorldCom and Enron. Lehman was the

    because it's quite complicated, they didn't realize that Lehman Brothers was the beating
    heart of the world's commercial paper market, in that the entire world, in the commercial
    paper market is what funds the working capital of all the large corporations in the world.
    That the world's financial system had basically frozen. And on Wednesday, for all you guys
    that have money market accounts, the prime reserve fund broke a buck for the first time. In
    other words, if you wrote a check four thousand dollars, you're going to get nine hundred
    dollars back. The Fed had pumped 500 billion dollars of liquidity in 24 hours into the
    system. And by the way, we know all this now because of

    in about three weeks. And that they could not guarantee any …. social and political chaos within a

     It's been difficult to track down the exact article that Bannon references here. That being said, there is a
        <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wnet/need-to-know/economy/the-true-cost-of-the-bank-bailout/3309/" target="_blank">
            Bloomberg</a> piece from September 2010 that aligns fairly close to the information Bannon gives.
    </div>
            </span>
        </span>it was about five trillion dollars of liquidity they needed into the system,
    of which, by the way, we've never really had an accounting. Right? We don't have an accounting today
    of what really went on and what liquidity got put into the system. This crisis is of such a magnitude.
    It's unprecedented in our country's history and unprecedented the world's history.
    <p></p>
    Let me just walk you through some math. Depending on the assumptions you make – Medicare, Social
    Security, Medicaid, and I realize people say ‘oh they're contingent liabilities,’ but they're pretty
    locked in unless you uncontingent them. The liabilities of those three are anywhere from sixty to a
    hundred trillion dollars. At a state level, the state governments today are about three trillion dollars
    underwater. Municipal governments - you see in Harrisburg, the capital of Pennsylvania, things just got
    taken over yesterday - municipal governments, I think are something like two trillion dollars underwater.
    Municipal employee pension funds are two trillion and corporate pension funds are a trillion dollars. The
    biggest problem we have which never gets talked about at any debate, has not been brought up one time -
    the trade deficit - which every quarter all the goods we buy from China, and all the foreign oil we buy,
    it’s seven trillion dollars. It's the beating heart of our problem - not one question in eight debates has
    been asked about it.

    <div id="accordion-9" class="accordion-section-content-green">
        Dr. Laurence Kotlikoff. As far as can be researched, Dr. Kotlikoff was never the head of Boston Universitys'
        Economics Department, though he is currently a professor there. Since 2009 he has been recognized as a William
        Fairfield Distinguished Professor, a title given to the most senior and distinguished professors in the department.
        It is perhaps that title that Bannon was thinking of when he speaks of him as the "head" of the department.
        He was one of Reagan's Council of Economic Advisers. He has also run for president as a write-in candidate
        in both the 2012 and 2016 elections. He didn't win either time.

    PhD, head of Boston University's Economics Department - very low-key guy. They call him the 200
    trillion-dollar man. He will walk you through a set of mathematics that shows you the liability side of
    the balance sheets about 200 trillion dollars, and his math is not that far from like the assumptions.
    The total assets in our country - let’s talk about a balance sheet and income statement so you can see
    the scale of the problem we got - all the assets combined, I think, in our country - all the stocks,
    Nasdaq, New York Stock Exchange, privately held companies, LLCs, all your companies, okay. All the cash,
    all the gold, all the real estate -  adds up to about 50 to 60 trillion dollars in assets. And we have
    200 trillion dollars and some of those contingent liabilities. But we are upside down.
    <p></p>
    The industrial democracies have a massive problem today we've never had. We are highly overleveraged.
    We have to go through a massive deleveraging. And we've built in a welfare state that is completely
    and totally unsupportable. Now, why … this is a crisis, and by the way, Barack Obama is not the problem.
    Barack Obama is a symptom of a problem. We have to remove Barack Obama. I don't doubt that for a second.
    We have to remove Barack Obama as president of the United States. But that's only the … and let's talk
    about this. We had this huge … the reason you're here today on a Tuesday night, listening to some really
    great guys who are sacrificing their lives and you guys to come to support in one of these new
    organizations when you could be doing anything else. And you're the kind of the thin blue line of what's
    going to save us. Because I go around and talk to two groups last night was in Torrance, it's a hundred
    people, it's always the same hundred guys. Men and women, throughout the country, every time I go, ok?
    <P></P>
    That's the scary thing. You are the guys are really going to save us. So the problem is that these
    numbers are so esoteric that even the guys  of Wall Street - the Goldman Sachs, the guys I work with,
    and the guys in the Treasury Department, because they've made some massive mistakes - and they're the
    first to admit that - but it's so tough to tie this together because the numbers are so esoteric,
    when you talk about a trillion and a half dollar deficits and three trillion dollars on federal spending

            <div id="accordion-10" class="accordion-section-content-purple">
       This is an odd one. In February 2009, a CNBC commentator named Rick Santelli gave an epic rant on the floor of

        election of Barack Obama. They are staunchly against any government overreach and are financially and socially
